2- faster code
```
ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);
```
**Explain**<br>
1. ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);<br>
By default, C++ cin and cout are synchronized with the C standard I/O functions (scanf and printf). This means that operations on cin and cout can be slower compared <br>to their C counterparts.<br>
Disabling synchronization (sync_with_stdio(false)) allows for potentially faster input and output operations in C++.<br>

2. cin.tie(nullptr);<br>
By default, cin is tied to cout, meaning that when cin is used, cout is flushed, and vice versa. This can introduce unnecessary flushing of the output buffer, <br>affecting performance.<br>
cin.tie(nullptr) unties cin from cout, preventing automatic flushing. This can lead to improved performance when there's no need for synchronized input and output<br>
